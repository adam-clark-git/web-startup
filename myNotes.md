# My Notes for CS260

## Reactivity things to do
* Fix errors:
* To add to game page:
    - No fill bucket, no clear tool, kinda annoying right now. (Might add later, but for now not needed.)
    - Game needs to load other user images
    - Game needs to show when other users finish the drawdle
* To add to login:
* To add to gallery:

## Things I've given up on
* Canvas breaks when resizing in middle of play without reloading (nonurgent) (Honestly pretty rare in the grand scheme of things? Might fix by making it a perfect square always, instead of switching depending on aspect ratio)
* Timer resets on page reload. Spent so much time on this, but the canvas doesn't, so good enough. (Might work on later tbh)
* Brush size is not aligned with the slider (Such a minor issue, don't wanna work on it though.)
* Abandonded all of multiplayer
