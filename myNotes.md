# My Notes for CS260

## Reactivity things to do
* Fix errors:
    - Login still appears when screen is minimized (Probably due to removal of class names from buttons)
    - Canvas breaks when resizing in middle of play without reloading (nonurgent)
* To add to game page:
    - Can take it as many times as you want, no once per day.
    - Timer completely reloads on page reload. Could be intentional? Canvas is also completely wiped on page reload, which is less good. ( could save every 10 seconds, and then load that if the date matches up?)
    - No fill bucket, no clear tool, kinda annoying right now.
    - Background is not perfectly white
    - timer is purely in seconds, not minutes & seconds or just a visual aid.
    - Brush size is not aligned with the slider
* To add to login:
    - Done
* To add to gallery:
    - need to create a json format with 3 values per object: 1 date 2 link to img 3 prompt
    - then need to load that object and display it
    - program in cases for loading more, and when it runs out.
* Multiplayer:
    - ???????????? This is too hard :(
