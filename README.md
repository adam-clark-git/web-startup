# Drawdle

[My Notes](notes.md)

This a daily drawing game. Every day, you get a new prompt, and then are given a short amount of time to draw it using limited tools. The goal is to get your creativity flowing quickly, and to not get to in your head about the quality of the picture. When the 90 seconds are up, you can then publish your picture, or see other people's pictures given the same theme.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

> If you are not familiar with Markdown then you should review the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) before continuing.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

The best way to start your day is with a little bit of creativity. With Drawdle, every day you get a new prompt and are challenged to draw it in 90 seconds. It's fast paced to encourage you to not stress over minor mistakes, while still pushing you to explore your creativity and get better at art. You can then share those designs with your friends and look at others interpretation of the prompt.
### Design

I contacted a TA who said that it was not required.

```

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **CSS** - Styling to work with both PC and phone usage and a simple design to let user pictures pop.
- **React** - Provides Log In, Drawing Functionality, Timer, Changing Color and Brush Size, and displaying other user pictures. Single page for more active design.
- **Service** - Backend endpoints for:
    * User Authentication. User log in, log out and register, with all credentials being safely stored in server.
    * Uploading picture to Server
    * Displaying other stored images.
    * Updating the prompt for each day.
- **DB/Login** - Stores user authentication, as well as pictures for each topic. Also stores rating scores for each picture.
